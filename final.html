			<p>When the NFL first started to gain popularity in the 1960’s, it appeared to be a beacon of light for the future of entertainment and pop culture when it came to intermixing with sports. Baseball, America’s previous favorite sport, soon took a backseat to the fun and exciting sport of football. Now, however, it appears that new shot of energy came, and continues to come, at a price. <br> <br> At its core, football is an incredibly violent sport. One of the main goals of the game is to forcefully bring your opponent down, many times with your head. Repeated blows to the head have been known to cause CTE, which stands for chronic traumatic encephalopathy -- better known as a concussion. <br> <br> CTE leads to many different side effects, including death. Over the years, many NFL players that have died young have later been found out to have passed due to CTE. Due to this, the NFL realized that they have a big issue on their hands.</p>

			<h3>Concussions are decreasing, but NFL still seeing many cases</h3>
			<p>	According to recent data from the NFL, the total number of concussions reported in 2015 was 275, while last season (2022) the league reported 213. This shows that the number is still going down, however it is still way higher than the NFL wants … and may be a deterrent for the younger generation when it comes to playing the sport. <br> <br> 	“You automatically assume the risk [of a concussion] when you play,” Kennan O’Malley, former football quarterback, said. “There’s risk everywhere in life and especially in football. Nowadays, tech is exceptionally better than it has ever been regarding helmets. The only thing is questioning whether or not that technology is accessible at every level of football. Ultimately, yes you should be skeptical [of playing football due to the risk of concussion] … kind of.” <br> <br> 	Many young people are worried, moreso now than in the past, of playing football due to the risks that come along with it. While the sport has always been dangerous and concussions have always been a risk, they are being brought to light now more than ever. <br> <br> 	The data, too, shows that while the number of concussions per season in the NFL is decreasing, it is still incredibly high -- too high for the NFL’s liking.</p>

			<h3>The NFL is taking steps to reduce concussions</h3>
			<p>	Over the past number of years, the NFL has taken many steps to try and decrease the risk of concussions in the sport. <br> <br> 	For example, the league has eliminated players running up to the line of scrimmage before a kickoff to decrease the chance of a concussion due to high-speed collisions during the ensuing action. Helmets have been improved, and more eyes are on the game during the matchup to look out for potential concussions. This means that even the slightest hint at a concussion means that a player could be pulled from the game. <br> <br> "If you were to remove gross motor instability as a judgment call, then yes, anybody who stumbles would be ruled out," Dr. Allen Sills, the NFL's chief medical officer, said in 2022. <br> <br> These are just some of the steps the league is taking to reduce concussions, and more can be expected down the line. The hope is that the number of concussions reported every year declines, season after season, until it hits zero and no player has to suffer from CTE ever again.</p>
